# PREDICTING THE UNPREDICTABLE
 
## Overview
This project was developed at **Imperial College** within the  **Ada Lovelace Academy** by **Group Barry** to **FEMA** to predict future lightning events.
This project involves the development of predictive models for storm tracking using various datasets, leveraging machine learning techniques. The task is divided into three subtasks: Task 1, Task 2, and Task 3, with each focusing on different aspects of storm prediction.
